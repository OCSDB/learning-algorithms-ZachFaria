# Cubing Log

## Log Date: Monday December 17th 2018
1. What did I try to learn?
- The Ortega Method (OLL and P2L algorithms)
- More Rubick's cube notation (to make sure I could properly follow along when learning the new algoritms)
- The positions of each color's opposite side's color (ex. green and blue) for the sake of using the OLL algorithms
2. How did I try to learn it?
- Watched a youtube video that showed me how the Ortega Method works (the algorithms used for each case)
- Found a PDF with the OLL and P2L algorithms 
- Practice
3. What were the end results?
- Learnt of new algorithms to solve the 2x2 more efficiently
- Know the positions of each color in respect to each other and know my rubik's cube a little notation better
- Much slower than the beginner's method that I know by heart at the moment
- Struggling a little bit with the algorithms (mainly P2L)

1. What did I try to learn?
- Continued trying to get use to the Ortega Method
- How P2L works
- How to solve a sigle layer efficiently
2. How did I try to learn it?
- Used the video and PDF to help with the algoritms
- A lot more practice
- Some good old trial and error to solve the first layer/face
3. What were the end results?
- Faster to solve a single face and second layer (still need the algorithms beside me to use OLL to solve the second layer)
- Know my notation a lot better now (enough so that I don't have to look it up anymore for the most part)
- Still strugling with P2L but getting slightly better at it

1. What did I try to learn?
- Main focus on trying to understand P2L as well as when (which case) to use which algorithm for both OLL and P2L
- To successfully solve the first face efficiently
- To start to memorize some of the algorithms
2. How did I try to learn it?
- A lot more practice
- Used the PDF for the algorithms
- Asked some other people who understood these algorithms better than myself
3. What were the end results?
- Can solve the first two layers (still need the algorithms for the OLL to solve the second layer and the first layer takes me longer than it should)
- I know the cases to use OLL but still have trouble with P2L
- Although I didn't time myself in front of my teacher, for now the beginners method seems to be much faster for me at the moment until I can grasp the Ortega method 
- Determined to learn the Ortega Method (one day)
